## Deep Image Neural Network

A simple but precise implemetation of stochastic gradient descent algorithm for a feedforward neural network where the gradients are 
calculated using backproagtion. 

The network is then trained with train.y and the trained weights and params are then save in trained_network.pkl.

The network code build's on Michael Nielsen's <a href="https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning">neural-networks-and-deep-learning book</a>
