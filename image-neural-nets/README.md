## Deep Image Neural Network

A simple but precise implemetation of stochastic gradient descent algorithm for a feedforward neural network where the gradients are 
calculated using backproagtion. 

The network is then trained with train.y and the trained weights and params are then save in trained_network.pkl.
The trained model can be tested with test.py for up to 5 sample images.
